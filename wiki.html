    <p>Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods,<br> which is based on artificial
         neural networks with representation learning. The adjective "deep" in deep learning refers to 
         the use of multiple layers<br> in the network.
         Methods used can be either supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.
         <br>
     
    Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks,
     deep reinforcement learning,<br> recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks and transformers
      have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing,
       machine translation, <br>bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material 
       inspection and board game programs,
       <br> 
    where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.<br>
(ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems.
     ANNs have various differences from biological brains.<br> Specifically, artificial neural networks tend 
     to be 
    static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analog.</p>

            <h1><b>Definition</b></h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that[8]: 199–200  uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.</p>
        <p>From another angle to view deep learning, deep learning refers to "computer-simulate" or "automate" human learning processes from a source (e.g., an image of dogs) to a learned object (dogs). Therefore, a notion coined as "deeper" learning or "deepest" learning[9] makes sense. The deepest learning refers to the fully automatic learning from a source to a final learned object. A deeper learning thus refers to a mixed learning process: a human learning process from a source to a learned semi-object, followed by a computer learning process from the human learned semi-object to a final learned object.</p></header>

            <p>Most modern deep learning models are based on multi-layered artificial neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and transformers, although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines</p>
        <p>In deep learning, each level learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation. In an image recognition application, the raw input may be a matrix of pixels; the first representational layer may abstract the pixels and encode edges; the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges; the third layer may encode a nose and eyes; and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level on its own. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction+
